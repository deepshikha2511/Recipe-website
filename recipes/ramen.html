        <li><strong>Prepare the broth</strong> : 
Depending on the type of ramen you're making, simmer pork bones, chicken, or vegetables with water and aromatics (such as ginger, garlic, and onions) to create a flavorful broth. Simmer the broth for several hours to extract the flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the noodles</strong> : Boil the ramen noodles separately according to the package instructions. Cook them until they reach the desired texture, usually al dente. Drain and rinse the noodles with cold water to stop the cooking process and remove excess starch. </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the protein</strong> : Prepare your chosen protein, such as chashu pork, chicken, beef, or tofu, according to your preference. This may involve marinating, grilling, or braising the protein until it's cooked and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the toppings </strong>: Prepare various toppings, such as sliced green onions, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, seaweed (nori), corn, soft-boiled eggs, sliced mushrooms, and narutomaki (fish cake). These toppings can be prepared and set aside for assembly.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the broth </strong>: Adjust the flavor of the broth by adding seasonings such as soy sauce, miso paste, salt, or other desired seasonings. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the ramen </strong>: In a serving bowl, place the cooked ramen noodles. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles, ensuring they are submerged. Arrange the prepared protein and toppings over the noodles and broth.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy </strong>: Serve the ramen hot and enjoy it immediately. Mix the ingredients well before eating and savor the delicious flavors of the ramen.</li>
